why should we use database?
mysql

to connect node to database we need libraries (mysql2)

in terminal we need to run these commands

npm init -y

npm install express mysql2 nodemon











in your app.js

const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

const pool = mysql.createPool({ pool

without database limited access
